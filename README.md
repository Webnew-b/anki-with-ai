# Anki Vocabulary Builder with AI + WordNet
Input a word → Validate → WordNet lookup → AI rewrite → Auto-sync to Anki
System architecture designed by the author, entire implementation generated by AI.

This project provides a fully automated pipeline that takes an English word as input, validates it, looks up WordNet senses, asks an AI model to rewrite definitions + generate examples, and finally inserts the result into Anki via AnkiConnect.

# Architecture Philosophy
The project architecture — including the pipeline design, component boundaries, interfaces, data flow, abstraction hierarchy, and failure model — is fully designed by the author (Lexon).

All actual source code (Python modules, class implementations, JSON parsing, providers, validators, etc.) is generated by AI according to the author's design specifications.

# Features

### Word Validation
- Ensures input contains **only A–Z / a–z** letters.
- Rejects invalid tokens.
- Guarantees clean dictionary queries.

### Dictionary Provider (WordNet)
- Extracts all senses for a given word.
- Returns:
  - synset ID  
  - POS  
  - definition  
  - example sentences  
  - hypernyms  
  - hyponyms  
  - lemmas (synonyms)  
- Limits to **top 10** senses.

### AI Provider
- Selects the most common everyday sense.
- Produces:
  - simplified English definition  
  - 2–3 natural example sentences  
  - polished Chinese translation  
- Outputs **strict JSON (no markdown/code blocks)**.

### Anki Integration
- Auto-creates a flashcard using your **custom VocabModel**.
- Fills all fields:
  - Word
  - POS
  - Definition
  - Definition Simple
  - Hypernyms
  - Hyponyms
  - Synonyms
  - WordNet Examples
  - AI Examples
  - Chinese
- Uses **AnkiConnect** (localhost:8765).

### Architecture is fully pluggable
- Replace dictionary backend (WordNet → Oxford → custom SQL)
- Replace AI model (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qiniu, local LLM)
- Replace Anki deck/model easily
